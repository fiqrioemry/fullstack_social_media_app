# üì∑ Instagram Clone ‚Äì Fullstack Web Application

Instagram Clone is a fullstack social media web application designed to replicate core features of Instagram. It enables users to create and interact with posts, follow other users, and send real-time chat messages. Built with Node.js (Express), MySQL, and MongoDB for the backend and React.js (Vite) with TailwindCSS on the frontend, this project focuses on scalability, security, and real-time engagement.

---

## 1. Project Overview

This project was developed to simulate a social platform where users can post, comment, like, follow, and message each other‚Äîjust like Instagram. Traditional social apps require complex data synchronization, scalable messaging systems, and role-based access. This clone demonstrates how to integrate these core systems using modern web technologies and a microservice-style structure for chat, auth, and notification handling.

---

## 2. Project Requirements

- Enable user registration with OTP and Google OAuth

- Allow users to create, edit, like, comment, and bookmark posts

- Implement nested comments with reply and mention capability

- Build real-time chat using Socket.IO with media support

- Implement a follower/following system

- Notify users of interactions such as likes, comments, follows

- Secure user sessions using JWT + Redis

- Manage scalable and secure media uploads via Cloudinary

---

## 3. The Challenge

- Creating a full-featured social media app required solving multiple challenges at once:

- Building a real-time chat system with persistence and media upload

- Managing nested comments and mentions within posts

- Supporting Google OAuth and OTP-based registration securely

- Ensuring state synchronization between Redis sessions, MySQL, and MongoDB

- Handling media uploads, file validation, and user file management using Cloudinary

---

## 4. The Approach & Solution

The backend is built using Express.js, with MySQL for structured data (users, posts, comments) and MongoDB for unstructured and real-time data (chat messages). JWT is used for secure user authentication, with Redis managing refresh tokens and session validation. Media is uploaded using Multer and stored in Cloudinary.

The frontend uses React.js (Vite) and Zustand for lightweight state management. Socket.IO enables real-time chat communication. The UI is styled with TailwindCSS and animated with Framer Motion, providing a responsive and engaging user experience.
